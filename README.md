## Compatibility
This package has been tested with `Unity 2022.3.22f` and the `VRChat SDK 3.8.2`.

It should function in projects both using and not using the *VRChat Creator Companion*.

## Important Note about Updating
If you previously installed an older version (`1.x.x`) of this package, it is recommended you first delete the entry for the repository within your User Packages if you added it to the VCC that way, before using the new Community Repository installation method below.

You can do this by, within the VCC, going to **Settings** > **Packages**, scrolling to the bottom and clicking the **(-)** (Remove) button beside the `com.nidonocu.vrcunitytoolbar-1.x.x` entry under **User Packages**.

Updates to this package will be automatically installable via the VCC using this new Community Repository feature.

## Installing
The most easy way to install this package's listing to the [VRChat Creator Companion](https://vcc.docs.vrchat.com/) using the Community Repository feature.

### Automatic Community Repository - (Recommended)
1. Click the big **Add Package Listing** button below if you're viewing this on the website or navigate to the [Virtual Gryphon Packages](https://nidonocu.github.io/virtual-gryphon-packages/) page.
2. Click the **Add to VCC** button at the package listing website.
3. If prompted by your web-browser, click **Open** on the pop-up confirmation that appears.
4. In the VRChat Creator Companion, a confirmation dialog will have appeared. Click **I Understand, Add Repository**.
5. Make sure the checkbox next to the new **Virtual Gryphon Packages** entry is checked.

Now you can install this package in to any project by doing the following:
1. Click the **Manage Project** project button for your project in the VRChat Creator Companion.
2. Make sure in the **Selected Repos** drop-down in the top right of the window, **Virtual Gryphon Packages** is enabled.
3. Scroll down the packages and find **VRC Unity Toolbar**, click the **(+)** (Add) button.
4. Open your project and the package will be installed.

### Manual Local Package Installation (Not Recommended)

This is the old method of adding this package to the VCC prior to the release of the Community Repository feature. Using this method you can load this package as a **User Package** so you can then install it in any of your projects, but it will not be automatically updated.

1. Download the **ZIP** version of the package using the buttons below if you're viewing this on the website or from the [releases page](https://github.com/Nidonocu/vrc-unity-toolbar/releases).
2. Extract this ZIP file to a long term storage location where you keep other downloaded tools. This should be named `vrc-unity-toolbar`.
3. In the VRChat Creator Companion, go to the **Settings** page.
4. Under **User Packages**, click **Add**.
5. Navigate into the folder containing the package files (`vrc-unity-toolbar`) and then click **Select Folder**.

Once added, you can then install this package on to any project:

1. Click the **Manage Project** project button for your project in the VRChat Creator Companion.
2. Make sure in the **Selected Repos** drop-down in the top right of the window, **Local User Packages** is enabled.
3. Scroll down the packages and find **VRC Unity Toolbar**, click the **(+)** (Add) button.
4. Open your project and the package will be installed.

### Manual Standard Unity Package

If you are not using the VRChat Creator Companion in a classic project, you can load this package from a file. This will not be able to automatically update and you should get your project updated to use the VCC as soon as possible!

1. Download the **Unitypackage** version of the package using the buttons below if you're viewing this on the website or from the [releases page](https://github.com/Nidonocu/vrc-unity-toolbar/releases).
2. Open your project in Unity.
3. From the **Assets** menu, choose **Import Package** and then **Custom Package**.
4. Find the Unitypackage file you downloaded (`com.nidonocu.vrcunitytoolbar-3.0.0.unitypackage` for example), select it and the click **Open**.
5. Ensure all items are selected and then click the **Import** button to complete the Install.

## How to Use
The package once installed, will add additional buttons to the Unity Toolbar found at the top of the editor.

Located to the right of the **toolbox**, you can find the following buttons.

![The Navigation Buttons](https://nidonocu.github.io/vrc-unity-toolbar/LeftUI.png)

### Selection Navigation

These buttons act much like the back and forward buttons on your web browser and let you move to a previously selected item without undoing changes like the built in Undo function

This includes both Objects within the current Scene and Assets within your Asset Library.

The navigation buttons will remember up to 100 navigation changes, including when testing in Play mode. Unlike previous versions, these will now also be preserved whenever you enter or leave **Play** mode, or recompile any scripts within the project.

To move back to a previous selection state, click the **Back** button. Once you have navigated backward, you can navigate forward again in your selection history by clicking the **Forward** button.

Selecting something new will always clear the Forward history, similar to how making a change after Undoing clears the ability to 'Redo'.

If you navigate back to an Object or Asset which no longer exists because it has been deleted or you have loaded a different scene, the current selection will just be set to nothing.

### Smart Duplication

Smart duplication performs the same action as the built in Unity **Duplicate** function, but with several changes that then save on follow up actions:

Smart Duplicates within a Scene will always appear directly under the original object in the hierarchy (or under other duplicates if multiple duplicates are made), rather than at the bottom of the sibling list.

Smart Duplicates will automatically identify and continue a numbering scheme if one is found within the original object. For example, if you name a lighting GameObject `Light 1 - Spot`, then smart duplicate it, it will be named `Light 2 - Spot` rather than the Unity default name `Light 1 - Spot (1)`.

Any existing leading zeroes if detected will also be duplicated, so `Probe 01` will be duplicated as `Probe 02` for example.

Only the first number in the name will be replaced so an object named `Part 1 - Zone 2` will be duplicated as `Part 2 - Zone 2`.

If an object has no existing number, then a number will be assigned based on numbering preferences that you can configure.

![Settings Panel](https://nidonocu.github.io/vrc-unity-toolbar/Settings.png)

You can access the configuration under Project Settings by going to the **Edit** menu and then **Project Settings** and then choosing **VRC Unity Toolbar** in the category list on the left.

Here you can find settings for the other features of the toolbar, along with the configuration settings for automatic numbering, and links to the project and developer's websites.

You can choose if you prefer numbers to start 1 or 2, depending on if you prefer zero or one based indexes for your objects in a scene.

You can choose the number of digits (and thus leading zeroes) for numbering. So for example, 1, 01 or 001 (to emulate numbering similar to that found in Blender).

You can choose to surround the number with different styles of brackets, either none, `()` (similar to the Unity default duplication system), `[]`, `{}` or `<>`.

You can choose a separator between the base name and the appended number, either no separator, a space, a pipe `|`, a dash `-`, a dot `.`, an underscore `_`, a dash with spaces ` - `, or a pipe with spaces ` | `.

âš  **Note:** Not all of these symbols are supported by computer filesystems so if you Smart Duplicate an asset in the Asset Database, some alternative symbols will be used. The Pipe Symbol `|` will be replaced with an Underscore `_`, a spaced pipe ` | ` with a spaced dash ` - ` and angular brackets `<>` with square brackets `[]`.

Located to the right of the **Play** and **Pause** buttons you can find the following toggle buttons.

![The Toolbar Buttons](https://nidonocu.github.io/vrc-unity-toolbar/UI.png)

### Focus Scene View

When activated, this will switch the active window back to the **Scene View** after hitting the Play button rather than the **Game View**.

This is useful, for example, if needing to test an Avatar and you need access to things such as the move gizmo for shaking the avatar to test its Physbones.

### Auto-Select Avatar

When activated, this will switch the currently selected item to the object containing the **Avatar Descriptor** component after hitting the Play button.

This is useful when using something such as [Lyuma Avatar 3.0 Emulator](https://github.com/lyuma/Av3Emulator) and needing to select the avatar to access the menu testing buttons, other emulator functions or for grabbing the avatar's gizmo to test its physbone movement.

After exiting Play mode, the selection will be *automatically restored* to the *previous item* you had selected when you pressed Play. If you turn off this feature while in Play mode, the current selection will be retained.

This function will only be available in VRChat Avatar projects.

### Auto-Select Gesture Manager

When activated, this will switch the currently selected item to the [Gesture Manger](https://github.com/BlackStartx/VRC-Gesture-Manager) control object after hitting the Play button.

This is useful when you want to test an avatar using this package's emulation features and testing interactivity and the avatar's menu.

If you have not yet added a Gesture Manager object to the scene and this feature is enabled, a Gesture Manager object will be added for the duration of the testing mode.

Like with Auto-Select Avatar, after exiting Play mode, the selection will be *automatically restored* to the *previous item* you had selected when you pressed Play. If you turn off this feature while in Play mode, the current selection will be retained.

This function will only be available in VRChat Avatar projects and obviously, the Gesture Manager package must be installed. This can be done automatically using the **VCC**.

In the main menu bar, a new menu with various useful functions can be found under **Tools** menu and then my name, **Nidonocu**!

![The Tools Menu](https://nidonocu.github.io/vrc-unity-toolbar/Tools_Menu.png)

The following functions can be found here:

### Change UI Component Fonts

![Change UI Component Fonts window](https://nidonocu.github.io/vrc-unity-toolbar/Change_Fonts.png)

This window can be used to update multiple legacy Text or TextMeshPro components in a Scene with a new font.

**Follow the instructions in the window** to perform this operation.

You could use this after importing a prefab (such as a video player) and change all of it's UI to match the same font style as the rest of your world's user interface.

Make sure to pick a [good font](https://fonts.google.com/)!

### Store Animations in Animators

This menu option opens a tutorial window to for a reminder of how to use this feature. Here's how it works:

**1.** First, create your animator controller and setup all the possible *layers* and *states* you want for your controller.

![Example Animator](https://nidonocu.github.io/vrc-unity-toolbar/Animator_Example.png)

**2.** Next, in the **Project** window, **right-click** the Animation Controller and click the new **Generate Child Animations** menu option.

![Animator Context Menu](https://nidonocu.github.io/vrc-unity-toolbar/Generate_Animations_Menu.png)

**3.** After a confirmation prompt, the animations will be generated in the animator, click the fold-out arrow to the side of the animator file to access the child animations.

![Child Animations](https://nidonocu.github.io/vrc-unity-toolbar/Child_Animations.png)

You can add more animations at any time by repeating the above steps.

***Important Note:*** You cannot remove individual animation assets once they have been created at this time, you can only delete all animations at once by choosing the **Delete Child Animations** option instead on the Animator's context menu.

### Generate Materials From Textures

This menu option lets you quickly create a set of materials from a set of texture files, using another material as a template.

![Generate Materials From Textures window](https://nidonocu.github.io/vrc-unity-toolbar/Materials_From_Textures.png)

**Follow the instructions in the window** to perform this operation.

This feature might be useful if you quickly want to import a lot of images in to your project and not have to setup materials for each one that will be identical, such as say, a photo gallery.

### Bulk Update a Material Property

This menu option lets you find all materials using a given shader and optionally, with a given value in one of the material's properties.

Once found, you can then change any other property on all those materials at once, rather than needing to find them spread out throughout your project files and updating each of them.

![Bulk Update a Material Property window](https://nidonocu.github.io/vrc-unity-toolbar/Bulk_Update_Material_Prop.png)

**Follow the instructions in the window** to perform this operation.

This feature is useful if you need to, late in your project, change a setting on many materials at once because of some project wide change.

### Quick Installers

The Quick Installers menu lets you quickly install a number of other packages by other developers. Currently this is just the Hierarchy Icons Unity editor package, and the Mochie shader pack (free edition).

#### Hierarchy Icons

This package updates your Hierarchy window to render icons to help you identify at a glance what is each object is in your Scene.

![Before and after installing Hierarchy Icons](https://nidonocu.github.io/vrc-unity-toolbar/Hierarchy_Icons.png)

Choose this option from the **Quick Installers** menu and the package will be automatically installed from it's [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/OpenUnityToolkit/HierarchyIcons). (You will need to have a **Git** client installed on your system for this to work.)

#### Mochie Shaders (Free)

This is a nice pack of good shaders for world use offering a nice selection of features without heavily increasing the download size for your world.

Alas, the one downside of this shader pack is that it is only currently available as a downloadable and manually installed Unity Package as the developer doesn't currently support any automatable workflow for updating and installing the package.

While I plan to work out a way to fix this in the future if they don't, for now this menu option under the **Quick Installers** menu will take you to their [GitHub](https://github.com/MochiesCode/Mochies-Unity-Shaders) download page so you can grab the latest version of their shader.
